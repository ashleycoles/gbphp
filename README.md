# GBPHP

PHP the way god intended.

A simple 'compiler' that converts GBPHP (Great British PHP) into vanilla PHP.

Inspired by Dave Childs article [If PHP Were British](https://aloneonahill.com/blog/if-php-were-british)

## Installation

1) Put the kettle on
2) Clone the repo
3) Put teabag in mug
4) Run `composer install`
5) Add hot water to mug
6) Update gbphp-config.json so the input directory (the location of the .gbphp files) and output directory (where the compiled php files are saved) are correct for your project
7) Remove teabag, add sugar and milk to taste
8) run `php compile-gbphp.php` to compile
9) Enjoy
